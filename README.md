# Data Structures in Python

A collection of Python projects based on the algorithms from the book "Data Structures The Fun Way" by Jeremy Kubica.

For now, this is just a first draft (or rather a direct conversion) of the pseudo pythonesque algorithms from the book into actual Python code. Improvements can be made of course but for now I kept the syntax as close as possible to the book. Will probably revisit later.

All the code is organized in Jupyter notebooks (actually Google Colab notebooks) based on each chapter with some personal notes on the implementation, examples of using it as well as graphical representations of some of the data structures using graphviz or matplotlib.

---
* C1-Arrays: a little bit about arrays (or lists in Python) with some basic operations like sorting, linear search or binary search
* C2-Linked Lists: a linked list implementation with operations to insert or delete nodes
* C3-Stacks & Queues: a stack/queue implementation as linked list or array
* C4-Binary Search Trees: just a BST implementation (with graphical representation)
* C5-Tries: a trie implementation (with graphical representation)
* C6-Heaps: a heap implementation (both min-heap and max-heap implementation supported) with heapsort algorithm and graphical representations
* C7-Grids: spatial representation and search of points in a 2d structure (grid) (with graphical representation)
* C8-Spatial Trees: Quadtree and k-d tree implementations (with graphical representations)
* C9-Hash Tables: a hash table implementation (yes, I know Python has dict for this but still ...) with two ways of handling collisions via chaining or linear probing
* C10-Caches: a simple LRU (least recently used) cache
* C11-B-Trees: a BTree implementation (with graphical representation)
* C12-Bloom Filters: a simple bloom filter implementation with several hash functions provided
* C13-Skip Lists: a skip list implementation (with graphical representation)
* C14-Graphs: a simple graph implementation and three graph algorithms (Dijkstra for minimum distance, Prim for minimum spanning tree and Kahn for topological sort) (with graphical representations)
